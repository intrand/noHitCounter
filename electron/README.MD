# No Hit Counter Electron

So far the idea is to use electron so the app can be wrapped up and distributed to multiple OS. 
Also it will allow the use of global hot keys.  Finally we can stand up an express along side the 
electron app to serve the nohitcounter page.

## Get started.  


```
npm instal -g electron
npm install
npm start
```
